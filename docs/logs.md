# logs

Displays logs for your app

You can optionally filter by a particular service, show timestamps or follow the logs a la `tail -f`.

::: warning Only shows logs written to `stdout` or `stderr`
Note that `lando logs` is a light wrapper around `docker logs` and as such it will only display logs that are written
to `stdout` of `stderr`. While we make a best effort to redirect logs when we can it is up to the user to redirect relevant
application logs.
:::

## Usage

```bash
# Get the logs=z
lando logs

# Follow the logs and show timestamps
lando logs -t -f

# Show logs for only the database and cache services
lando logs -s cache -s database
```

## Options

Run `lando logs --help` to get a complete list of options defaults, choices, etc.

```bash
--follow, -f      Follow the logs
--help            Shows lando or delegated command help if applicable
--services, -s    Show logs for the specified services only
--timestamps, -t  Show log timestamps
