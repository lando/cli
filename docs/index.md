title: Lando CLI Usage, How Do I Use It?
description: Lando is a CLI driven tool by default, here are all the out of the box commands it runs.

# CLI Usage

While Lando is actually a library that can be implemented various ways it ships with a command line interface by default. The command line interface is dynamic which means if it detects a `Landofile` it will augment your list of available commands with any relevant `tooling` that has been set up by that `Landofile`.

**If you do not run most of these commands in a directory that contains a Landofile you will likely not get the expected result.**

::: warning Windows users must use a real, non-emulated, TTY
This is an upstream "restriction" imposed on us by NodeJS and python. We recommend using the shell shipped with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) but only the `cmd.exe` variant NOT the one powered by `minTTY`. That said your safest bet is to use `cmd.exe` or `PowerShell`. Other shells may work but have not been tested.

If your shell does not work you will likely see an error message like `the input device is not a TTY.`

## With tooling

Each Landofile may implement _additional_ [tooling commands](https://docs.lando.dev/config/tooling.html) that are only available for that application. These commands are usually wrappers for development tools like `lando composer` or `lando artisan` or `lando npm`.

Run `lando` inside of an app to see if it offers any app specific tooling options. Here is an example of what the default `lamp` recipe will give you. Note the additional app-specific commands like `lando composer` and `lando db-import`.

```bash
Usage: lando <command> [args] [options]

Commands:
  lando composer          Runs composer commands
  lando config            Displays the lando configuration
  lando db-export [file]  Exports database from a service into a file
  lando db-import <file>  Imports a dump file into database service
  lando destroy           Destroys your app
  lando info              Prints info about your app
  lando init              Initializes code for use with lando
  lando list              Lists all running lando apps and containers
