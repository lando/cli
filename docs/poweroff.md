# poweroff

Spins down all lando related containers

This is useful if you want to deactivate all the containers needed to run Lando. If you have another service that requires usual system resources like ports `80` and `443` this command will free them up.

## Usage

```bash
lando poweroff
```

## Options

```bash
--help         Shows lando or delegated command help if applicable
--verbose, -v  Runs with extra verbosity
```
